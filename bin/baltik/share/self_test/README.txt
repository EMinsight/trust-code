basic_kernel: duplicates Extraire_Domaine keyword, but since the batlik is linked with kernel numeric only (which does not containt Extraire_Domaine), this should work, and the test case should pass.
basic_kernel_faux: same as above, but this time linked with complete TRUST, so the linking should work, but test should fail ("duplicate type")
basic_with_prerequis: test prerequisite compilation
