\begin{itemize}
\item First, you must have already done the commands of the first section.
\vspace{0.2cm}

\item Open a terminal and run the commands to create a directory for your studies: \\
\textbf{mkdir -p \; $\sim$/test/yourname}\\
\textbf{cd \; $\sim$/test/yourname}
\vspace{0.2cm}

\item \label{method_copy} Copy a test case from the TRUST database to your study with the command:\\
\textbf{trust -copy\index{trust -copy} Obstacle}\\
\textbf{cd Obstacle}
\vspace{0.2cm}

\item Run the test case with the command:\\
\textbf{trust Obstacle}\\
\vspace{0.2cm}

\item Edit there the data file Obstacle.data and change some lines in order to modify the time step to 0.004s:\\
\textbf{nedit Obstacle.data \&}\\

\begin{itemize}
\item Add to the post processing block of Obstacle.data the following elements :\\

    \begin{itemize}
    \item [$\circ$] A segment of pressure probes between the points (0.01, 0.12) and (0.91, 0.12).
    \vspace{0.1cm}

    \item [$\circ$] A segment of velocity probes between the points (0.92, 0.00) and (0.92, 0.22) to see the velocity profile behind the square cylinder.
    \vspace{0.1cm}

    \item [$\circ$] Add the vorticity to the fields being post processed and change the writing period to 0.5s. To find the keyword for this field, you can open the Generic Guide with:\\
    \textbf{trust -doc \&\index{trust -doc \&}}
    \vspace{0.1cm}

    \item [$\circ$] Add the keyword "\textbf{format lata\index{format lata}}" inside the block, just before the keyword \textbf{fields} in order to use the post processing tool VisIt during and/or after the calculation.
    \vspace{0.1cm}

    \item [$\rightarrow$] You have access to useful resources in the \$TRUST\_ROOT/index.html file with your favourite browser (eg: firefox). Take few minutes to find test case examples containing a particular keyword thanks to the \underline{Keywords} link: \\
    \textbf{firefox \$TRUST\_ROOT/index.html \&} \\

\begin{itemize}

\item Launch the tool "PLOT2D" to compute calculation and visualize results with: \\
\textbf{trust -evol\index{trust -evol} Obstacle \&}

\item To run the calculation, click on the button "Start computation!" at the bottom left corner of the window.

\item Visualization:
    \begin{itemize}
    \item [$\circ$] Select "PRESSION(X=0.13,Y=0.105)" in the left list to see the evolution of your pressure probe and click behind on "Plot".
    \item [$\circ$] Check the velocity profile behind the square cylinder with "VITESSE\_X(X=0.14,Y=0.115)" and "VITESSE\_Y(X=0.14,Y=0.115)".
    \item [$\circ$] Visualize the equation residuals on the same plot, select "$ Ri = max \left| \frac{dV}{dt} \right|$" and "$residu = max \left| Ri \right|$" using the button "Plot on same" or select the two graphs with "Ctrl" button and "plot".
    \end{itemize}
\vspace{0.1cm}

%\item Check the convergence monitoring: plot 0 in the first menu to open the convergence menu, then open the 4 following plots:
%    \begin{itemize}
%    \item [$\circ$] Pressure linear system convergence at each time step
%    \item [$\circ$] Residual error $\left\Vert Ax-B \right\Vert$ of the pressure linear system at the last time step
%    \item [$\circ$] Time step evolution
%    \item [$\circ$] Flow rate error evolution
%    \end{itemize}
%Type "5" to quit this menu and return to the first one.
%\vspace{0.1cm}
%\item Open the menu "Surface fluxes characteristics" (plot1), visualize:
 %   \begin{itemize}
 %   \item [$\circ$] the drag exerted by the fluid on the square Cylinder (plot 1, then 4 for the square), close this menu with 7.
%    \item [$\circ$] the "Pressure drag + Friction drag" with 5 and select the Square boundary (4). Each drag is plotted together with the total drag also called viscous drag.

or using "PLOT2D" tool: \textbf{trust -evol\index{trust -evol} Obstacle \&} and click on "Visualisation" on the right menu.

    \begin{itemize}
    \item [$\circ$] First, we are going to configure VisIt: {\footnotesize{In the menu File $\rightarrow$ Open file, select Off instead of Smart for File grouping option. For the Filter, specify *.lata to list only the LATA results file. Then save your choices, in the menu Options $\rightarrow$ Save Settings.}}

    \item [$\circ$] In the menu File $\rightarrow$ Open file, select the Obstacle.lata file.

    \item [$\circ$] Visualize the mesh in the "Plots" area with "Add $\rightarrow$ Mesh $\rightarrow$ dom" then click on the button "Draw". Zoom and move the mesh in the right window. You will un-zoom with right button (View $\rightarrow$ Reset view) or with a combination of CTRL keypad and left button.

    \item [$\circ$] Visualize the pressure field ({\footnotesize{Plots area: "Add $\rightarrow$ Pseudocolor $\rightarrow$ PRESSION\_SOM\_dom" + Draw then select the last time on the Time slider}})
    \item [$\circ$] Suppress or hide the mesh (Select Mesh then click on Delete or Hide/Show).

\frametitle{Parallel calculation: method 1}
\begin{block}{}

The goal of this exercise is to introduce parallelism in the data file of the previous exercise.

\begin{itemize}
\item Go to the previous study (should be done) and after you had suppressed the \textbf{reprise} keyword and set \textbf{tinit\index{tinit}} to 0 again in the \textit{Obstacle.data} file, create the two new files:\\
\textbf{cd $\sim$/test/yourname/Obstacle} \\
\textbf{mkdir PARA1} \\
\textbf{cd PARA1} \\
\textbf{cp ../Obstacle.data DEC\_Obstacle.data} \\
\textbf{cp ../Obstacle.data PAR\_Obstacle.data} \\
\textbf{cp ../Obstacle.geo .}\\
\vspace{0.3cm}
\item Edit the first file (\textit{DEC\_Obstacle.data}) to create the partition of the mesh.
\end{itemize}

\end{block}
\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Parallel calculation: method 1}
\begin{block}{}

\begin{itemize}
\item In this file, uncomment the block around the \textbf{Partition} keyword.
    \begin{itemize}
    \item [$\circ$] Here, the partitioning tool \textbf{Metis\index{Metis}} is used. We cut in \textbf{nb\_parts\index{nb\_parts}} blocks, here in 2.
    \item [$\circ$] The overlapping width \textbf{Larg\_joint\index{Larg\_joint}} between two parts of the partition should be defined according to the numerical scheme higher order, generally the convective scheme. Its value is generally 1 for the two order scheme, and 2 for the three or four-order scheme like Quick\index{quick} scheme.
    \item [$\circ$] In VEF, you should use \textbf{2} for \textbf{Larg\_joint\index{Larg\_joint}} except when partitioning a domain where only the conduction equation will be solved.
    \item [$\circ$] At least, the keyword \textbf{zones\_name\index{zones\_name}} is useful to define the name of the files containing the partitioned mesh and to write these files.
    \item [$\circ$] Notice the presence of the keyword \textbf{End} in the "Partition" block: the code will stop to read the data file at this point!
    \end{itemize}

\item Run the data file: \textbf{trust DEC\_Obstacle}

\item Check the partitioned mesh files DOM\_0000.Zones and DOM\_0001.Zones are generated in your directory: \textbf{ls *.Zones}
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Parallel calculation: method 1}
\begin{block}{}

\begin{itemize}
\item Now, edit the file PAR\_Obstacle.data and comment the read of the mesh
(\textbf{Read\_file}) and uncomment the \textbf{Scatter} keyword which will read the partitioned
mesh. Visualize it with VisIt:\\
\textbf{trust -mesh\index{trust -mesh} PAR\_Obstacle}

\item Now, run a parallel calculation with TRUST:\\
\textbf{trust PAR\_Obstacle 2}

\item The post-processing task is identical in sequential or parallel mode. You have the
probes into the .son files and the whole fields in the .lata files. To run VisIt with the
command line:\\
\textbf{visit\index{visit} -o PAR\_Obstacle.lata \&}

\item Select the last time step and visualize the blocks (with Plots: Add $\rightarrow$ Subset $\rightarrow$ blocks)
which represent the parts of the domain partition, then the velocity fields. You can
also visualize a field only on a selected part (block) with the menu Control $\rightarrow$ Subset.

\item To visualize probes after the end of the calculation, you can run the command line:\\
\textbf{trust -evol\index{trust -evol} PAR\_Obstacle \&}

\begin{itemize}
\item The existing tool \textbf{make\_PAR.data\index{make\_PAR.data}} is useful on the data files \underline{which have} the marks MAILLAGE/MESH, DECOUPAGE/PARTITION and LECTURE/SCATTER. If you run the following commands: \\
\vspace{0.2cm}

\item First we will create a new working directory with our data files:\\
\textbf{cd $\sim$/test/yourname/Obstacle} \\
\textbf{mkdir PARA2} \\
\textbf{cd PARA2} \\
\textbf{cp ../Obstacle.data exemple.data}\\
\textbf{cp ../Obstacle.geo .}\\

\begin{itemize}
\item It creates:
    \begin{itemize} 
    \item [$\circ$] a \underline{SEQ\_exemple.data} file which is a copy of the sequential data file exemple.data,
    \item [$\circ$] a \underline{DEC\_exemple.data} file which is the first data file to be run. It is immediately run by the command line \textbf{make\_PAR.data} to create a partition (with 3 sub zones here), located in the ***.Zones files. \\
    \textbf{ls *.Zones}\\
    Note that the code stops reading this file at the keyword "End" just before the "\# END PARTITION \#" block.
    \item [$\circ$] a \underline{PAR\_exemple.data} file which is the data file for the parallel calculation. It uses the ***.Zones files to read the mesh through the line "Scatter DOM.Zones dom". Note that the meshing and cut of the mesh are commented here.
    \end{itemize}

\item Then you have to run the calculation by the usual command completed by the number of processors needed:\\

\item Be careful when you want to modify you data file! You have two possibilities:
    \begin{itemize} 
    \item [$\circ$] you want to modify your mesh,
    \item [$\circ$] you want to modify the calculation parameters.
    \end{itemize}

\item For the first one, you can modify:
    \begin{itemize} 
    \item [$\circ$] the file exemple.data and run \textbf{make\_PAR.data}. But it will \underline{erase} the DEC\_exemple.data, SEQ\_exemple.data and PAR\_exemple.data files and create new zones. Then it will run the new DEC\_exemple.data file which gives your new ***.Zones files \underline{or},
    \item [$\circ$] the meshing part of file DEC\_exemple.data and run it with:\\
    \textbf{trust DEC\_exemple.data} \\
    \end{itemize}

\item Save definitively your choices with File $\rightarrow$ Save Options As default.

\item Now, look at the file.geo file, you can see the definition of parameters, points, lines... You can see the position of the points and lines with theirs numbers in gmsh.

\item Modify the file to suppress the obstacle. We want to keep only 4 points and 4 lines, so you have to suppress the points 5,6,7,8 and the lines 1,3,4,5. For this, you have to:
    \begin{itemize}
    \item [$\circ$] comment (with "//") the definition of the points 5,6,7 and 8.
    \item [$\circ$] comment the definition of the lines 1,3,4,5. Note that the "Circle" is a line so "Circle(1)=Line(1)".
    \item [$\circ$] modify the line(2), it will now links points 1 and 2.
    \item [$\circ$] comment the "Physical Line" named "Shape" which use the line(1) (= Circle(1)) and the line(3).

\item Build a TRUST data file with the \textbf{Postraiter\_domaine\index{Postraiter\_domaine}} keyword, to read the mesh (like in the Salome exercise page \pageref{read_mesh}). Visualize the mesh with VisIt.
\item Then we will try to create a 3D mesh, by using the Extrusions feature of Gmsh. See more about extrusions in \textcolor{blue}{\underline{http://geuz.org/gmsh/doc/texinfo/gmsh.html}}.
\item Save your initial file in a new one named file3D.geo.

\item Comment the line "Physical Surface("domain") = \{1\};" in 3D we will have a "Physical Volume" which will be define at the end of the .geo file.
\item Define the "Physical Surface" which will be the boundaries of your geometry with the number of the surfaces which can be read on the geometry plotted by gmsh:\\
Physical Surface("Inlet") = \{38\};\\
Physical Surface("Outlet") = \{30\};\\
Physical Surface("Wall") = \{1,26,34,55\};\\
Physical Surface("Obstacle") = \{42,46,50,54\};\\
\item Define you physical volume, you can see its number in yellow in the window:\\
Physical Volume("dom") = \{1\};

%\item In 3D, you will use "Plane Surface" to define the boundaries of your domain and "Physical Surface" (instead of Physical Line in 2D) to name these boundaries: \\
%\begin{tabular}{ll}
%{\small{Line Loop(1) = \{15,6,1,14\};}}         & {\small{// Line loop of several lines}}   \tabularnewline

%{\small{Physical Surface("Inlet") = \{1\};}}    & {\small{// Naming boundary is MANDATORY}} \tabularnewline
%\end{tabular}
%\item You will need to define a volume and a physical volume at the end of .geo file:
%\begin{tabular}{ll}
%{\small{Surface Loop(1) = { 1,2,8,12,16,20 } ;}}    & {\small{ // Surface Loop of Plane Surfaces }}     \tabularnewline

%%%%\item Then, click on the button "Default" to define the initial block and edit the dimensions file. 
%%%%\item Note that the files "maillagedefaut" and "defaut.prep" are saved in your directory (with "save" in nedit for "maillagedefaut" and "Save file prepro" in Xprepro for defaut.prep).

%%%%\item It is a 2D geometry, so we will define:

%%%%    \end{itemize}

%%%%\item The coordinates of the center of the first cylinder, which after will be duplicated, are (x0, y0)=(0.6, 0.4). So the distance between to cylinder center is $dx=0.8$ and $dy=0.3$. Declare and initialize this parameters $(x0, y0, dx, dy)$ in your "maillagedefaut" file.
