This directory contains files that can be compiled in TRUST or in lata2dx
(source code is strictly identical).
They might use classes which are not common (ArrOfDouble, Entree, Octree, ...) but
which provide the same functionalities. Compatibility classes for lata2dx
are located in ../triou_compat/
