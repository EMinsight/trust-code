To detect the environment, run:
./configure

A file env/machine.env will be created.
You can then edit this file and some others (env/make.linux*)
to change some default values.

To initialize:
source env/env_TRUSTa.sh


To build a binary with a single directory build:
make optim # Create an optimized binary <=> OPT="_opt";monodir  	(Will build into a $TRUST_ROOT/MonoDir_mpi_opt/src directory)
make debug # Create a debug binary	<=> OPT="";monodir		(Will build into a $TRUST_ROOT/MonoDir_mpi/src directory)
make prof  # Create a profiled binary   <=> OPT="_opt_pg";monodir 	(Will build into a $TRUST_ROOT/MonoDir_mpi_pg_opt/src directory)

To build a binary with the multi-directory build (not usual):
make	   # Create a semi optimized binary <=> OPT="_opt";compile	(Will build into each $TRUST_ROOT directories...)

To clean (will delete all .o and .a of TRUST sources, inside directories or MonoDir_... directories)
make clean

To clean also the third party libraries:
./configure -clean
