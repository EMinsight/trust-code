# **How to start ?**

To detect the environment, run:

	$> ./configure

A file env/machine.env will be created. You can then edit this file and some others (env/make.linux*) to change some default values.

To initialize:

	$> source ./env_TRUST.sh

To build a binary with a single directory build:

	$> make # Create an optimized debug binaries
	$> make optim # Create an optimized binary
	$> make debug # Create a debug binary
	$> make prof  # Create a profiled binary  

To check:

	$> make check

To clean (will delete all .o and .a of TRUST sources, inside directories or MonoDir_... directories)

	$> make clean

To clean also the third party libraries:

	$> ./configure -clean

      or

      $> source /home/trust_trio-public/env_TRUST-1.8.3.sh

- for CEA Saclay cluster (orcus):

      $> source /home/trust_trio/env_TRUST-1.8.3.sh

- for CEA Marcoule cluster (ceres2):

      $> source /softs/trio_u/env_TRUST-1.8.3.sh

- for CCRT-TGCC supercomputers (cobalt & irene-ccrt):

      $> source /ccc/cont002/home/den/triou/env_TRUST-1.8.3.sh

- for CCRT-TGCC supercomputers (irene-amd int64):

      $> source /ccc/work/cont002/den/triou/irene-ccrt/TRUST/TRUST-1.8.1-int64/env_TRUST.sh

- for CINES supercomputer (occigen):

      $> source /panfs/panasas/softs/applications/trio_u/TRUST/env_TRUST-1.8.3.sh
