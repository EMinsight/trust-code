  Title "Validation of a binary mixture flow problem with a Low Mach Number approximation"
  Description "This document aims at validating the binary mixture flow problem of TRUST. Recall that this problem is used with a Low Mach Number (LMN) approximation and is only valid with iso-thermal and iso-bar conditions. The validation is carried out by injecting air into an axi-symmetrical cavity filled with air at rest (same properties for both species). Results are compared with those obtained by a non-compressible thermo-hydraulic problem (same physical parameters are used). The results in both cases are coherent as expected. For completeness, the influence of using of an explicit or a semi-implicit Rational Runge-Kutta (RRK2) time-integration scheme is also investigated for both cases. "

  Title "Conclusions"
  Description "\latex_(We have presented in this document a validation concerning the TRUST binary mixture flow problem with a LMN approximation. Results show that considering two identical species reproduce exactly what is obtained by a non-compressible thermo-hydraulic problem. Moreover, we show that the explicit and the semi-implicit time integration schemes lead to identical results if a good time step is used and can be safely used to reduce a bit the computational time \\ \textbf{Note : } the influence of the time step is not illustrated here but tested. In particular, higher facsec values ($>1$) lead to a stable solution but with different results. \latex_)"
