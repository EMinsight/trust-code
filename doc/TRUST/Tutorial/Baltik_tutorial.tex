    \begin{itemize}
    \item [$\circ$] add an "\#include <Interprete\_geometrique\_base.h>" in my\_first\_class.h,
    \item [$\circ$] switch "Objet\_U" to "Interprete\_geometrique\_base" in the .h and .cpp files,
    \item [$\circ$] rebuild your application.\\
    \item [$\circ$] An error will occur!
    \end{itemize}

\item You will have an error indicating a pure virtual function ("interpreter\_") should be implemented.

\item Look at the "Interprete\_geometrique\_base" class:
    \begin{itemize}
    \item [$\circ$] Eclipse: highlight the string "Interprete\_geometrique\_base" and push the F3 button of your keyboard to open the declaration file of this class
    \item [$\circ$] Or with the HTLM documentation: open the declaration file of the "Interprete\_geometrique\_base" class

\item Notice the "interpreter()" method (which calls the "interpreter\_()" method).

\item This method is called each time a keyword is read in the data file (eg: "Read\_file dom dom.geom", "Solve pb",...).

(just print a message with "Cerr" like "- My first keyword!") into the cpp file. 

\item "Entree" is a TRUST class to read an input stream (from a file for example):\\

\begin{block}{Part 1}

\begin{itemize}
\item To call it in the data file, you have to use the following syntaxe as the read of the parameters is done by the readOn method:
\begin{center}
\fbox{ \begin{minipage}[c]{0.9\textwidth}
\begin{alltt}
{\bf{A}} a\\
{\bf{Read}} a \{ {\bf{dimension}} 3 {\bf{option}} fast \}
\end{alltt}
\end{minipage}}
\end{center}

\item In our case, the read of the parameters will be done by the interpreter() method so the syntax in the data file will be the following:
\begin{center}
\fbox{ \begin{minipage}[c]{0.9\textwidth}
\begin{alltt}
{\bf{my\_first\_class}} \{ {\bf{domaine}} dom {\bf{option}} 0 \} \\
\textcolor{blue}{\# dom is the domain name \#}
\end{alltt}
\end{minipage}}
\end{center}

\item Add into the "interpreter\_(Entree\&)" method the read of these parameters into braces using the \textbf{Param} object.

\item \textbf{Param} use is the recommended choice in this case (even though many current TRUST classes are still using the old fashion to read parameters), because it
greatly simplifies the coding.

Interprete\_geometrique\_base::associer\_domaine ( Nom \& nom\_dom)

\item Look the HTML documentation. What is the task of this method?

\item Once implementation is finished, add a check at the end of the method
"interpreter\_(Entree\&)" and find how to print the domain name:
\begin{center}

\begin{itemize}
\item We are going to try to print information of the domain boundaries in our current project.

\item Edit the "my\_first\_class.cpp" file and add into the "interpreter\_()" method a loop on the boundaries.

\item Look for help inside the "Domaine", "Zone", "Bord", "Frontiere" classes into the HTML documentation to access to the:
    \begin{itemize}
    \item [$\circ$] Number of boundaries (\textbf{nb\_bords()} method)

\begin{itemize}
\item The information is in the "Zone\_VF" class (a "Zone\_dis" discretized zone) which can't be accessed 
from the domain, only from the problem. 

\item So we need to read another parameter in our data file:\\
\begin{center}

{\bf{my\_first\_class}} \{ {\bf{domaine}} dom {\bf{option}} 0 {\bf{problem}} pb \}

\item Then, remember the "equation" or "problem" UML diagram of the presentation's slides.

\item Look for help inside the "Zone\_VF", "Probleme\_base" and "Equation\_base" into the HTML documentation to access to the:
    \begin{itemize}
    \item [$\circ$] equation (\textbf{equation(int)} method)
    \item [$\circ$] discretized zone (\textbf{zone\_dis()} method)
    \item [$\circ$] control volumes (\textbf{volumes\_entrelaces()} method)

\begin{itemize}
\item You will need to cast the discretized zone returned by the \textbf{zone\_dis()} method into a "Zone\_VF" object.

\item You will print the size of the control volumes array with something like:
\begin{center}

\begin{alltt}
{\bf{Cerr}} <\textcompwordmark{}< control\_volumes.size() <\textcompwordmark{}< {\bf{finl}};

\item Where control\_volumes is a \textbf{DoubleVect} returned by the \textbf{Zone\_VF::volumes\_entrelaces()} method.
\item If you look at the "Problem" UML diagram of the presentation's slides, you will notice a better path to access to the discretized zone.
\item What is this path ?
\item Now, compute and print the sum of the control volumes with a "for" loop.

%Terminology/chronology of methods in TRUST
%interpreter()/readOn()
%→ The parameters of the keyword are read
%associer()
%→ Called by a Associate keyword, generally to fill the references (pointer) to other objects (eg : link to an Equation)
%discretiser()
%→ Called by Discretize keyword, complete tasks related to the selected discretization (eg : discretize a field)
%completer()
%→ All the data file is read, and some initializations are completed now
%Loop in the Probleme\_base class on each equation -> Probleme\_base.cpp
%Loop in Equation\_base class on each operator, discretized boundary condition, sources and time sheme -> Equation\_base.cpp
%preparer\_calcul()
%→ Before the first time step (eg : initialize arrays, set time to 0)
%Loop in the Probleme\_base class on each equation -> Probleme\_base.cpp
%calculer()
%→ During the time step, perform the main task of the class
%mettre\_a\_jour()
%→ At the end of the time step (eg : update time field)
%Loop in the Probleme\_base class on each equation -> Probleme\_base.cpp
%postraiter()
%→ At the end of the time step, post process the fields into the result files
