./configure

A file env/machine.env will be created.

to change some default values.

To initialize:
source env_TRUST.sh

make # Create an optimized debug binaries
make optim # Create an optimized binary 
make debug # Create a debug binary
make prof  # Create a profiled binary  

To check:

./configure -clean
