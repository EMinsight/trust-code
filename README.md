# **How to install TRUST-1.9.1 version ?**

### **First method**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/cea-trust-platform/trust-code.git TRUST-1.9.1
cd TRUST-1.9.1
wget ftp://ftp.cea.fr/pub/TRUST/externalpackages/externalpackages-1.9.1.tar
tar xf externalpackages-1.9.1.tar
./configure -help # To see the possible configure options.
./configure $OPTIONS  # At the end of configure, file env/machine.env will be created. You can then edit it and some others (env/make.linux*) to change some default values.
make
```

**Warning:** Check carefully the MPI version you want to use for parallel computing before installing the code, especially onto a HPC cluster.

Run the following command, mpicxx should be found into the bin directory of the MPI version you plan to use:

```bash
type mpicxx
```

### **Second method**

```bash
wget ftp://ftp.cea.fr/pub/TRUST/TRUST/Version1.9.1/TRUST-1.9.1.tar.gz
tar xzf TRUST-1.9.1.tar.gz
cd TRUST-1.9.1
./configure $OPTIONS
make
```

# **How to install TRUST development version  ?**
**for developers and those interested in new features only.**

**Warning: "next" branch may not compile or some tests fail if important developments merged**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/cea-trust-platform/trust-code.git TRUST-next
cd TRUST-next
git checkout next
wget ftp://ftp.cea.fr/pub/TRUST/externalpackages/externalpackages-next.tar
tar xf externalpackages-next.tar
./configure $OPTIONS 
make
```

# **How to start ?**

To initialize TRUST:

```bash
source ./env_TRUST.sh
```

To build a binary with a single directory build:

```bash
make       # Create optimized and debug binaries and tools
make optim # Create an optimized binary
make debug # Create a debug binary
make prof  # Create a profiled binary
```

To check:

```bash
make check
```

To clean (will delete all .o and .a of TRUST sources, inside directories or MonoDir_... directories)

```bash
make clean
```

To clean also the third party libraries:

```bash
./configure -clean
```
