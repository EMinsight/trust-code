\begin{block}{}

\begin{itemize}
\item First, initialize the TRUST environment. On CEA Saclay PCs, TRUST versions are available with (e.g. X.Y.Z=1.7.1):\\
\vspace{0.2cm}
\textbf{source  /home/triou/env\_TRUST\_X.Y.Z\_patch.sh}
\vspace{0.5cm}

\item Second, several editors (vi, emacs, nedit) are configured to highlight TRUST keywords in the data files. If you prefer using \textbf{nedit}, please do the following:

    \begin{itemize}
    \item [$\circ$] Run \textbf{nedit}, and select Preferences $\rightarrow$ Save Defaults.
    \item [$\circ$] Then re-initialize the TRUST environment (cf first point), the message "nedit.rc updated" should appear.

    \vspace{0.1cm}

    \item [$\circ$] Add the vorticity to the fields being post processed and change the writing period to 0.5s. To find the keyword for this field, you can open the User's manual with:\\
    \textbf{trust -doc \&\index{trust -doc \&}}
    \vspace{0.1cm}

    \item [$\circ$] Add the keyword "\textbf{format lata\index{format lata}}" inside the block, just before the keyword \textbf{Champs} in order to use the post processing tool VisIt during and/or after the calculation.
    \vspace{0.1cm}

    \item [$\rightarrow$] You have access to useful resources in the \$TRUST\_ROOT/index.html file with your favourite browser (eg: firefox). Take few minutes to find test case examples containing a particular keyword thanks to the \underline{Keywords} link: \\

To quit this tool, close the plots and type "\#".

\item Once the calculation is finished, visualize the results with the graphical tool VisIt: \textbf{visit \&}

    \begin{itemize}
    \item [$\circ$] First, we are going to configure VisIt: {\footnotesize{In the menu File $\rightarrow$ Open file, select Off instead of Smart for File grouping option. For the Filter, specify *.lata to list only the LATA results file. Then save your choices, in the menu Options $\rightarrow$ Save Settings.}}

    \item [$\circ$] In the menu File $\rightarrow$ Open file, select the Obstacle.lata file.

    \item [$\circ$] Visualize the mesh in the "Plots" area with "Add $\rightarrow$ Mesh $\rightarrow$ dom" then click on the button "Draw". Zoom and move the mesh in the right window. You will de-zoom with right button (View $\rightarrow$ Reset view) or with a combination of CTRL keypad and left button.

\frametitle{Parallel calculation: method 1}
\begin{block}{}

The goal of this exercise is to introduce parallelism in the data file of the previous exercise.

\begin{itemize}
\item Go to the previous study (should be done) and after you had suppressed the \textbf{reprise} keyword and set \textbf{tinit} to 0 again in the \textit{Obstacle.data} file, create the two new files:\\
\textbf{cd $\sim$/test/yourname/Obstacle} \\
\textbf{mkdir PARA1} \\
\textbf{cd PARA1} \\
\textbf{cp ../Obstacle.data DEC\_Obstacle.data} \\
\textbf{cp ../Obstacle.data PAR\_Obstacle.data} \\
\textbf{cp ../Obstacle.geo .}\\
\vspace{0.3cm}
\item Edit the first file (\textit{DEC\_Obstacle.data}) to create the partition of the mesh.
\end{itemize}

\end{block}
\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Parallel calculation: method 1}
\begin{block}{}

\begin{itemize}
\item In this file, uncomment the block around the \textbf{Partition} keyword.
    \begin{itemize}
    \item [$\circ$] Here, the partitioning tool \textbf{Tranche} is used. We cut in 2 bands according to X axis and 1 band according to Y axis. 
    \item [$\circ$] The overlapping width \textbf{Larg\_joint} between two parts of the partition should be defined according to the numerical scheme higher order, generally the convective scheme. Its value is generally 1 for the two order scheme, and 2 for the three or four-order scheme like Quick scheme.
    \item [$\circ$] In VEF, you should use \textbf{2} for \textbf{Larg\_joint} except when partitioning a domain where only the conduction equation will be solved.
    \item [$\circ$] At least, the keyword \textbf{Nom\_Zones} is useful to define the name of the files containing the partitioned mesh and to write these files.
    \item [$\circ$] Notice the presence of the keyword \textbf{End} in the "Partition" block: the code will stop to read the dta file at this point!
    \end{itemize}

\item Run the data file: \textbf{trust DEC\_Obstacle}

\item Check the partitioned mesh files DOM\_0000.Zones and DOM\_0001.Zones are generated in your directory: \textbf{ls *.Zones}
\end{itemize}

\end{block}
\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Parallel calculation: method 1}
\begin{block}{}

\begin{itemize}
\item Now, edit the file PAR\_Obstacle.data and comment the read of the mesh
(\textbf{Read\_file}) and uncomment the \textbf{Scatter} keyword which will read the partitioned
mesh. Visualize it with VisIt:\\
\textbf{trust -mesh PAR\_Obstacle}

\item Now, run a parallel calculation with TRUST:\\
\textbf{trust PAR\_Obstacle 2}

\item The post-processing task is identical in sequential or parallel mode. You have the
probes into the .son files and the whole fields in the .lata files. To run VisIt with the
command line:\\
\textbf{visit -o PAR\_Obstacle.lata \&}

\item Select the last time step and visualize the blocks (with Plots: Add $\rightarrow$ Subset $\rightarrow$ blocks)
which represent the parts of the domain partition, then the velocity fields. You can
also visualize a field only on a selected part (block) with the menu Control $\rightarrow$ Subset.

\item To visualize probes after the end of the calculation, you can run the command line:\\
\textbf{trust -probes PAR\_Obstacle}
\end{itemize}

\end{block}
\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Parallel calculation: method 2}
\begin{block}{}

\begin{itemize}
\item The existing tool \textbf{make\_PAR.data} is useful on the data files \underline{which have} the marks MAILLAGE/MESH, DECOUPAGE/PARTITION and LECTURE/SCATTER. If you run the following commands: \\
\textbf{cd $\sim$/test/yourname/Obstacle} \\
\textbf{mkdir PARA2} \\
\textbf{cd PARA2} \\
\textbf{cp ../Obstacle.data exemple.data}\\
\textbf{cp ../Obstacle.geo .}\\
\textbf{make\_PAR.data exemple 3}\\
\textbf{ls *.data *.Zones}\\

\item It will create a DEC\_exemple.data file and will immediately run this file to create a partition with 3 sub zones. The command make\_PAR.data will also create PAR\_exemple.data file and then you will run the calculation by the usual command:\\
\textbf{trust PAR\_exemple 3}

\item Post-process the results and compare with VDF discretization about the CPU performance: the VEF calculation is running 10 times slower (cause higher number of pressure unknowns and smaller time steps). Study the docond.out file to see the time steps for each equation.

\item Accelerate the calculation by impliciting the diffusion operators of each equation with \textbf{diffusion\_implicite} option in the explicit Euler scheme (check again the User's manual: \textbf{trust -doc \&\index{trust -doc \&}}). Run the calculation.

\item \label{schema_impl} Use a full implicit scheme now (suppress \textbf{diffusion\_implicite}), by substituting \textbf{Schema\_Euler\_Explicite} by \textbf{Schema\_Euler\_implicite} and adding the \textbf{Implicite} solver. Have a look at the User's manual for the \textbf{gmres} options and define accordingly to the advices given into the User's manual, a value for \textbf{facsec, facsec\_max}.

\begin{itemize}
\item Copy the study named \textbf{FTD\_all\_VDF}. This test case deals with a 3D two phase flow in a tank with one initial interface between liquid and gas, a droplet, and a rotating solid in the liquid. The model used is the Discontinuous Front Tracking method and the mesh is 3D structured mesh. Notice that the 2D Discontinuous Front Tracking method has not been intensively tested yet.

\item Notice the name of the problem : \textbf{Probleme\_FT\_disc\_gen}. This refers to the Discontinuous Front Tracking method.

\item Notice the keyword \textbf{modele\_turbulence}. Navier-Stokes equation of the Discontinuous Front Tracking problem needs the read of this keyword even if the flow is laminar. In this case, use the \textbf{nul} keyword just after \textbf{modele\_turbulence}. Else, specify the turbulence model chosen.

\item Increase the height of the tank (0.06 to 0.12) and add a second drop above the first one, at $z=0.08$ (keywords \textbf{ajout\_phase0/ajout\_phase1} could be useful to add other interfaces).

The first one (add \textbf{format lata\index{format lata}}) is the classical block for post processing probes and fields. Here, we want to see the concentration field and the "indicatrice" field. Value of this field is 0 for liquid and 1 for gas, so the interface is located at "indicatrice" value 0.5.

\item Change the interpolation location of \textbf{indicatrice} and the \textbf{concentration} fields in the first post processing block, by adding the keyword \textbf{elem} just after the fields: the values in the post processing tool will be plotted at the centre of each element of the mesh.

\item The second one is the new syntax to post process interfaces moving meshes. You can visualize it with \textbf{VisIt}. On each interface, you can plot several fields ie: curvature with \textbf{courbure} keyword and velocity interface with \textbf{vitesse} keyword, pe field is for debugging purpose, it is useless here, you can suppress it) on several locations (on nodes with \textbf{sommets} keyword, on cells with \textbf{elements} keyword).

In menu Tools $\rightarrow$ Options $\rightarrow$ Geometry $\rightarrow$ Visibility, select Lines, Surfaces, Point numbers, Line numbers, Surface numbers. Save definitively your choices with File $\rightarrow$ Save Options $\rightarrow$ As default.

\item Now, look at the file.geo file and change the variables and add the circle. Rename the boundaries. You will press Reload in the gmsh GUI to update the geometry visualization.

\item Mesh in 2D, export it to a MED file then build a TRUST data file to read the mesh. Visualize the mesh with the \textbf{Postraiter\_domaine} keyword.

\item Try then to create a 3D mesh, by using the Extrusions feature of Gmsh. See more about extrusions in \textcolor{blue}{\underline{http://geuz.org/gmsh/doc/texinfo/gmsh.html}}.

\item In 3D, you will use "Plane Surface" to define the boundaries of your domain and "Physical Surface" (instead of Physical Line in 2D) to name these boundaries: \\
\begin{tabular}{ll}
{\small{Line Loop(1) = \{15,6,1,14\};}}         & {\small{// Line loop of several lines}}   \tabularnewline
{\small{Line Loop(2) = \{15,16,17,18\};}}       & {\small{// Line loop of several lines}}   \tabularnewline
{\small{Plane Surface(1) = \{ 1,2 \} ;}}        & {\small{// Surface/boundary defined}}     \tabularnewline
{\small{Physical Surface("Inlet") = \{1\};}}    & {\small{// Naming boundary is MANDATORY}} \tabularnewline
\end{tabular}

\item You will need to define a volume and a physical volume at the end of .geo file:
\begin{tabular}{ll}
{\small{Surface Loop(1) = { 1,2,8,12,16,20 } ;}}    & {\small{ // Surface Loop of Plane Surfaces }}     \tabularnewline
{\small{Volume(1) = { 1 } ;}}                       & {\small{ // Volume defined }}                     \tabularnewline
{\small{Physical Volume("domain") = 1;}}            & {\small{ // Naming domain is MANDATORY }}         \tabularnewline
\end{tabular}

\item Mesh and export it to a MED file. Run gmsh again on this exported MED file to check everything is defined:\\
\textbf{gmsh file.med}

\item Now, read the mesh by TRUST. You can, for example, take the first exercise and create a Obstacle\_VEF.data file (from a copy of Obstacle\_VDF.data) to read the MED file and run the simulation on the unstructured mesh.

In this exercise, you will learn how to create a 2D mesh with Xprepro. You will have a look at the "virus" example (button Examples) to see how to build a loop in the viewlist.

\begin{itemize}
\item Run Xprepro in the TRUST environment:\\
\textbf{Xprepro}

\item First, have a look at the Examples (Copy and Read button on virus example) to understand how you will use fortran code in the viewlist to create loops for building your cylinders.

\item Then, click on the button Default to define the initial block and edit the dimensions file. It is a 2D geometry, so we will define zomin=0. and zomax=0.01. The other dimensions of the initial block are xomin=0., xomax=7.8, yomin=0., yomax=2., eps=0.0001 (tolerance).

\item The cylinder radius is R=0.2 , the coordinates of the centre of the first cylinder, which after will be duplicated, are xoc=0.6 and yoc=0.4. Create 2 Fortran loops to copy the first cylinder in the two directions X and Y.

\item With the button Add , build the boundary blocks named \textbf{inlet} (index -1000), \textbf{outlet} (index -2000), and \textbf{lateral} (index 0). Don't forget to name the blocks.

\item Check the other objects in the viewlist and save your work with the button Save file prepro then check the name of the boundaries with Boundaries informations.

\item Run the model with Modeling run.... A window is opened where you will check the nodes coordinates of the mesh.

\item Click on Pre-mesh visualization to check your pre-mesh. Warning, it is always a 3D model in Xprepro, even if you wish a 2D mesh. By default, you see the indexes between 1000 and -3000. If you don't see the cylinders, create a 2D slice in the XY plane in VisIt to see inside the 3D pre-mesh.
