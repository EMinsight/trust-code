To install TRUST:
-----------------

1. To install version X.Y.Z of TRUST, create a directory to install TRUST. 
Move into this directory the file TRUST-X.Y.Z.tar (and eventually the
file PatchX.Y.Z.tar containing a patch for TRUST). Then run the following commands
to untar the files (the version before the eventual patch):

$ tar xvf TRUST-X.Y.Z_ARCH.tar
$ tar xvf PatchX.Y.Z.tar

Several files appear and in particular the file you read and
the Intaller_TRUST install script.

2. Run the Installer_TRUST script to install TRUST automatically.

$ ./Installer_TRUST

Several questions may be asked to you, for example, if you want to
re-compile TRUST.

If things didn't work smoothly and you can't figure out how to
modify the configuration so that it builds properly on your system
you can send e-mail to triou@cea.fr for more assistance.

3. Follow carefully the last instructions of the Installer_TRUST script
to configure your environment.
