<HR><h1> Use development version</h1><HR>
<h2>Principle behind the use is as follows </h2>
The TRUST development version allows creating several versions
modifying usual classes or creating new classes.
During initialization, three directories are automatically created 
to your service.

<I>$HOME/atelier</I> contains source files or modified by yourself.

<I>$HOME/atelier/exec</I> contains source files, objects files, makefile
useful to get a TRUST <B>debug version </B>.

<I>$HOME/atelier/exec_opt</I> contains source files, objects files, makefile
useful to get a TRUST <B>optimised version</B>.

<h2>Compilation</h2>
The development version allows you to compile a version from an archive library <I>TRUST_opt.a</I>
(located in directory <I>$TRUST_ROOT/lib</I>) who contains the whole TRUST 
object files, and modified files located in your directory <I>$HOME/atelier</I>.


<h2>Available versions</h2>
This development version is supported on following operating systems:

HP HP-UX 10.x
SGI Irix 6.x
Linux 2.x
IBM AIX 4.x 

For other systems, the portability depends on the Unix command 'makedepend'. 

<h2>Errors identified</h2>
Please, do not use Ctrl-C in compilation window,
several files would be corrupted, and compilation  would be impossible.

Strange things happen ?
Erase <I>$HOME/atelier/exec</I> or <I>$HOME/atelier/exec_opt</I> 
and compile again from the interface. 
The previous mentionned directories will be re-created.
