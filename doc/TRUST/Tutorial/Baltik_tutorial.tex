    \item [$\circ$] one "project.cfg" file.

\item You can see your file and the three directories on the "untracked" files section.
It means that they are not followed by the git repository for the moment.

\item To add all your directories and files to the git repository, you have to prepare a commit:\\
\texttt{\$ git add -\,-all}\\

\item Now you can send your commit to add your files to your git repository:\\
\texttt{\$ git commit -m "Initial commit"}\\

\item The previous command launches the "baltik\_build\_configure" script and the "configure" script directly.

\item Check the status of your git repository:\\
\texttt{\$ git status}\\

\item You can see that the file "project.cfg" has been modified. And that there are new untracked files.
It means that there are not on the git repository.

\item To see only the changes on the git repository files:\\
\texttt{\$ git status -\,-u=no}\\

\item Track changes via gitk (GUI interface of Git):\\
\texttt{\$ gitk \&}

\item You can see informations about your first commit and actual untracked changes.

\begin{itemize}
\item We want to change the inheritance of the class in order that it inherits from "Interprete\_geometrique\_base" class
instead of "Objet\_U".

\item "Interprete\_geometrique\_base" class is the base class of all the keywords doing tasks on domains (eg: Mailler, Lire\_fichier,...).

\item You will:
    \begin{itemize}
    \item [$\circ$] add an "\#include <Interprete\_geometrique\_base.h>" in my\_first\_class.h,
    \item [$\circ$] switch "Objet\_U" to "Interprete\_geometrique\_base" in the .h and .cpp files,
    \item [$\circ$] rebuild your application with Eclipse or in the terminal.\\
    \item [$\circ$] An error will occur!
    \end{itemize}

\item You will have an error indicating a pure virtual function ("interpreter\_") should be implemented.

\item Look at the "Interprete\_geometrique\_base" class thanks to F3 (Open Declaration)
from Eclipse and notice the "interpreter()" method (which calls the "interpreter\_()" method).\\

\item Define the public method "interpreter\_(Entree\&)" in the include file and implement it
(just print a message with "Cerr" like "- My first keyword!") into the cpp file. 
\item "Entree" is a TRUST class to read an input stream (from a file for example):\\
"virtual Entree\& interpreter\_(Entree\&);"
\item Rebuild your project and fix your files until the binary of your project is built (named
basic if you have not changed the name in the project.cfg file)\\

\begin{itemize}
\item To call it in the data file, you have to use the following syntaxe as the read of the parameters is done by the readOn method:
\begin{center}
\fbox{ \begin{minipage}[c]{0.9\textwidth}
\begin{alltt}
{\bf{A}} a\\
{\bf{Read}} a \{ {\bf{dimension}} 3 {\bf{option}} fast \}
\end{alltt}
\end{minipage}}
\end{center}

\item In our case, the read of the parameters will be done by the interpreter() method so the syntax in the data file will be the following:
\begin{center}
\fbox{ \begin{minipage}[c]{0.9\textwidth}
\begin{alltt}
{\bf{my\_first\_class}} \{ {\bf{domaine}} dom {\bf{option}} 0 \} \\
\textcolor{blue}{\# dom is the domain name \#}
\end{alltt}
\end{minipage}}
\end{center}

\item Add into the "interpreter\_(Entree\&)" method the read of these parameters into braces using the \textbf{Param} object.

\item \textbf{Param} use is the recommended choice in this case (even if a lot of
current TRUST classes still use the old fashion to read parameters), cause it
simplifies greatly the coding.

\item Look for help inside the "Domaine", "Zone", "Bord", "Frontiere" classes into the HTML documentation to access to the:

    \begin{itemize}
    \item [$\circ$] equation (\textbf{equation(int)} method)

\begin{itemize}
\item Run a test case with Valgrind:\\
\texttt{\$ cd \$project\_directory/}\\
\texttt{\$ source env\_basic.sh}\\
\texttt{\$ cd build/Cx/}\\
\texttt{\$ VALGRIND=1 trust Cx}\\
\item The Valgrind messages appear on the screen with the beginning of each line the same number. For example:\\
\texttt{\$ ==26645== ...}\\
\item The last line indicates if errors have occurred. An example with 0 error:\\
\texttt{\$ ==26645== ERROR SUMMARY: 0 errors from 0 contexts (suppressed: 0 from 0)}
\end{itemize}
\begin{itemize}
\item Now we will modify the sources in your baltik project to generate a Valgrind error on the Cx test case.\\

\begin{itemize}
\item Edit the "my\_first\_class.cpp" file and remove the initialization of the sum to calcule the total of control volumes.\\
In place of "double sum=0;", put only "double sum;".\\
\item Rebuild your project and run the test case:\\
\texttt{\$ cd \$project\_directory}\\
\texttt{\$ make debug optim}\\
\texttt{\$ cd build/Cx/}\\
    \begin{itemize}
    \item [$\circ$] in mode optim:\\
    \texttt{\$ exec=\$exec\_opt trust Cx}\\
In this case, no error appears.
    \item [$\circ$] in mode debug:\\
    \texttt{\$ exec=\$exec\_debug trust Cx}\\
In this case also, no error appears.
    \item [$\circ$] in mode valgrind:\\
    \texttt{\$ VALGRIND=1 exec=\$exec\_opt trust Cx}\\
On the other hand, in this case, there are errors.\\
    \texttt{\$ ==7517== ERROR SUMMARY: 187 errors from 109 contexts}

%Terminology/chronology of methods in TRUST
%interpreter()/readOn()
%→ The parameters of the keyword are read
%associer()
%→ Called by a Associate keyword, generally to fill the references (pointer) to other objects (eg : link to an Equation)
%discretiser()
%→ Called by Discretize keyword, complete tasks related to the selected discretization (eg : discretize a field)
%completer()
%→ All the data file is read, and some initializations are completed now
%Loop in the Probleme\_base class on each equation -> Probleme\_base.cpp
%Loop in Equation\_base class on each operator, discretized boundary condition, sources and time sheme -> Equation\_base.cpp
%preparer\_calcul()
%→ Before the first time step (eg : initialize arrays, set time to 0)
%Loop in the Probleme\_base class on each equation -> Probleme\_base.cpp
%calculer()
%→ During the time step, perform the main task of the class
%mettre\_a\_jour()
%→ At the end of the time step (eg : update time field)
%Loop in the Probleme\_base class on each equation -> Probleme\_base.cpp
%postraiter()
%→ At the end of the time step, post process the fields into the result files
%Example : LES Turbulence model in Mod\_turb\_hyd\_ss\_maille.cpp
