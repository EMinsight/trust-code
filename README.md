# **How to start ?**

To detect the environment, run:

	$> ./configure

A file env/machine.env will be created. You can then edit this file and some others (env/make.linux*) to change some default values.

To initialize:

	$> source ./env_TRUST.sh

To build a binary with a single directory build:

	$> make # Create an optimized debug binaries
	$> make optim # Create an optimized binary 
	$> make debug # Create a debug binary
	$> make prof  # Create a profiled binary  

To check:

	$> make check

To clean (will delete all .o and .a of TRUST sources, inside directories or MonoDir_... directories)

	$> make clean

To clean also the third party libraries:

	$> ./configure -clean
